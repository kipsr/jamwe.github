        <h1>ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVASION POLICY</h1>
        <p>Our policy at Jamwe limited is to recognize our responsibility to protect the environment and
            minimize any adverse environmental impact of its activities, as far as is safe, practicable and
            economical, with the objective of being incident free. It is also our practice to identify areas of
            opportunity to develop an environmentally sustainable business. This is carried out at an overall
            business management, and project-by-project level upon review of project specific environmental
            and sustainability aspects and impacts.</p>
        <h1>HEALTH AND SAFETY</h1>
        <p>We regard safety as paramount in the delivery of all our services and operate a Safety
            Management System (SMS). The SMS adopts the principles of the HSE guidance “Successful
            Health and Safety Management” and is operated in full compliance with all current safety
            legislation. Our Safety, Health and Welfare policy document, details our commitment to safeguard
            our personnel and third parties against accidents or incidents in and around the workplace. Within
            our SMS, emphasis is placed upon:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hazard Identification and Analysis</li>
            <li>Risk Assessments</li>
            <li>Training and Awareness</li>
            <li>Control of Sub Contractors</li>
        </ul>
        <P>We have an excellent system of ensuring our employees are made aware of the hazards they are
            facing, and control measures are put in place to minimize the risks. We place a great deal of
            emphasis to on-site and workshop awareness, inductions, competency and ongoing toolbox talks
            to ensure our employees and sub-contractors take the necessary due care and attention and
            continue to work as safely as possible</P>
        <P>Our professional approach to safety continues to result in an excellent safety record. In setting
            Health and Safety objectives for the company, the general principle is to aim for Accident and
            Incident Free in all that we do. Recognizing that the working environment is not ‘Risk Free’, we
            aim, as far as reasonably practicable, to minimize the risk of injury or work related ill health to an
            absolute minimum</P>
        <p>In recognition of our excellent health and safety performance and very low accident rate our
            Health and Safety objectives are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Zero lost time accidents.</li>
            <li>To ensure site requirements are fully satisfied, recognized by client feedback and high
                customer satisfaction scores on health and safety. Taking action should there be any
                deviation from the expected high standards.</li>
            <li>Risk Assessments reviewed to ensure they fully reflect activities carried out, hazards and
                risk factors and implementing applicable safe methods of working.</li>
            <li>Ensuring all employees are fully aware of the hazards they face and the safe working
                practices they must adopt to minimize the risks, and that key Health and Safety messages
                are re-enforced and accepted.</li>
